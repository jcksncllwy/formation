  "description": "Formation is a thin ETL service that transports data from completed Typeforms
into a MongoDB database. When run, Formation will check the last time it was
executed and ask Typeform for any forms that have been completed since then.
This makes Formation ideal for usage with crontab or another scheduler to get
regular updates.",
